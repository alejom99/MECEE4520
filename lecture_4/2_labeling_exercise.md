## Scraping Exercise

In this exercise, we're going to use the output generated in the scraper exercise,
and use it as the input into [doccano](https://doccano.herokuapp.com) to label
some data.

1. Run Jupyter

        $ jupyter notebook

2. In your browser, go to: http://localhost:8888/tree

3. Open up 2_labeling_example.ipynb and execute the different steps. Take
time to understand what each step is doing as you may need it for your homework.
